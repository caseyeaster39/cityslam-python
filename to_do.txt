Improve loop detection and loop closure
Single Vehicle, Multiple RSU
    - Implement content management, content distribution
Multiple Vehicles, Multiple RSU
    - Full-sclae merging, distributed optimization, etc.
    - Merging with anchor search for loop closure/place recognition

Startup data for vehicles is unlabeled
    - Propagate first label backward?

Reevaluate loop nodes (probably don't need to add one every time we are merging a node to the pose graph)
    - Posting should cover this type of data handling
