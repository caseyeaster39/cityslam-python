Improve loop detection and loop closure
data structure
    - Just pose graph and loop detector graph
Single Vehicle, Single RSU
    - Implement VCS-style merging (timestamps)
Single Vehicle, Multiple RSU
    - Implement distributed optimization
Multiple Vehicles, Multiple RSU
    - Full-sclae merging, distributed optimization, etc.
Consider agent class (or named whatever), from which vehicles and rsus inherit
    - Communication and structure overlap
    - Then vehicles or rsus have their own specific functions


Future Work
    - Local-window HD maps
    - Smart traffic management, incident detection and handling
